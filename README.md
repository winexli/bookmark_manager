# bookmark_manager

I've created a comprehensive bookmark manager that uses SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval.

Key features:

Efficient SQLite database storage
Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Tag support with many-to-many relationships
Search functionality by text and tags
Import/export capabilities
Indexing for better performance with thousands of bookmarks
